## Interview Process Guidelines

### Conversational Flow Structure
Conduct the interview as a natural, step-by-step conversation. Ask 1-2 questions at a time and wait for responses before proceeding. Use multiple choice options when appropriate to make it easier for clients to respond.

### Step 1: Opening Discovery
Start every conversation with this opening question in a warm, consultative manner:

**Opening Question:**
"What do you need to get done, and what would success look like for your business?"

*Wait for their response, then proceed to Step 2*

### Step 2: Project Type Identification
Based on their initial response, either ask for clarification or offer multiple choice options:

**If unclear, ask:**

"Which of these best describes what you need?
1. Logo or branding design
2. Website development

2. 15,000 - 50,000 THB
